It comprises all scientific disciplines and aspects of scholarly practices, including basic and applied sciences, natural and social sciences and the humanities, and it builds on the following key pillars: open scientific knowledge, open science infrastructures, science communication, open engagement of societal actors and open dialogue with other knowledge systems.* -- UNESCO, 2021\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"30%\"}\n![[UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science, 2021](https://www.unesco.org/en/open-science/about)](images/unesco2021.jpeg)\n:::\n\n::::\n\n## What is Open Science? {.smaller}\n\n***Open Science** is a movement and set of practices aimed at making scientific research more accessible, transparent, and reusable for everyone â€” not just for other scientists, but also for the public, educators, policymakers, and industry.*\n\n![Patrick Hochstenbach, 2012](images/os-cartoon-pub.png)\n\n# Open Science Values and Principles\n\n## Open Science Values and Principles\n\n![UNESCO (2021)](images/unesco-open-science.png)\n\n## Values {.smaller}\n\n***Quality and integrity:** Open Science should respect academic freedom and human rights and support high-quality research by bringing together multiple sources of knowledge and making research methods and outputs widely available for rigorous review and scrutiny, and transparent evaluation processes.* -- UNESCO, 2021\n\n<br>\n\n**TL;DR:** Open Science upholds academic freedom and human rights while fostering high-quality research through openness, inclusivity, transparency, and rigorous peer review.\n\n## Values {.smaller}\n\n***Collective benefit:** as a global public good, open science should belong to humanity in common and benefit humanity as a whole. To this end, scientific knowledge should be openly available and its benefits universally shared. The practice of science should be inclusive, sustainable and equitable, also in opportunities for scientific education and capacity development.* -- UNESCO, 2021\n\n<br>\n\n**TL;DR:** Open Science is shared, inclusive, and equitable global good benefiting all of humanity.\n\n## Values {.smaller}\n\n***Equity and fairness:** open science should play a significant role in ensuring equity among researchers from developed and developing countries, enabling fair and reciprocal sharing of scientific inputs and outputs and equal access to scientific knowledge to both producers and consumers of knowledge regardless of location, nationality, race, age, gender, income, socio-economic circumstances, career stage, discipline, language, religion, disability, ethnicity or migratory status, or any other grounds.* -- UNESCO, 2021\n\n<br>\n\n**TL;DR:** Open Science ensures equitable access and participation for all researchers, regardless of background or location.\n\n## Values {.smaller}\n\n***Diversity and inclusiveness:** open science should embrace a diversity of knowledge, practices, workflows, languages, research outputs and research topics that support the needs and epistemic pluralism of the scientific community as a whole, diverse research communities and scholars, as well as the wider public and knowledge holders beyond the traditional scientific community, including indigenous peoples and local communities, and social actors from different countries and regions, as appropriate.* -- UNESCO, 2021\n\n<br>\n\n**TL;DR:** Open Science embraces and values diverse knowledge systems, practices, and voices within and beyond the scientific community.\n\n## Principles {.smaller}\n\n***Transparency, scrutiny, critique and reproducibility:** increased openness should be promoted in all stages of the scientific endeavour, with the view to reinforcing the strength and rigour of scientific results, enhancing the societal impact of science and increasing the capacity of society as a whole to solve complex interconnected problems. Increased openness leads to increased transparency and trust in scientific information and reinforces the fundamental feature of science as a distinct form of knowledge based on evidence and tested against reality, logic and the scrutiny of scientific peers.* -- UNESCO, 2021\n\n<br>\n\n**TL;DR:** Open Science strengthens scientific rigor, transparency, trust, and societyâ€™s ability to address complex challenges.\n\n## Principles {.smaller}\n\n***Equality of opportunities:** all scientists and other open science actors and stakeholders, regardless of location, nationality, race, age, gender, income, socio-economic circumstances, career stage, discipline, language, religion, disability, ethnicity or migratory status, or any other grounds, have an equal opportunity to access, and contribute to and benefit from open science.* -- UNESCO, 2021\n\n<br>\n\n**TL;DR:** Open Science ensures equal opportunity for all to access, contribute to, and benefit from scientific knowledge.\n\n## Principles {.smaller}\n\n***Responsibility, respect and accountability:** with greater openness comes greater responsibility for all open science actors, which, together with public accountability, sensitivity to conflicts of interest, vigilance as to possible social and ecological consequences of research activities, intellectual integrity and respect for ethical principles and implications pertaining to research, should form the basis for good governance of open science.* -- UNESCO, 2021\n\n<br>\n\n**TL;DR:** Open Science demands responsibility, integrity, and ethical accountability.\n\n## Principles {.smaller}\n\n***Collaboration, participation and inclusion:** collaborations at all levels of the scientific process, beyond the boundaries of geography, language, generations and resources, should become the norm, and collaboration between disciplines should be promoted, together with the full and effective participation of societal actors and inclusion of knowledge from marginalized communities in solving problems of social importance.* -- UNESCO, 2021\n\n<br>\n\n**TL;DR:** Open Science requires inclusive, cross-disciplinary, and global collaboration to address societal challenges.\n\n## Principles {.smaller}\n\n***Flexibility:** due to the diversity of science systems, actors and capacities across the world, as well as the evolving nature of supporting information and communication technologies, there is no one-size-fits-all way of practicing open science. Different pathways of transition to and practice of open science need to be encouraged while upholding the above-mentioned core values and maximizing adherence to the other principles hereby presented.* -- UNESCO, 2021\n\n<br>\n\n**TL;DR:** Open Science requires flexible, context-specific approaches guided by shared core values.\n\n## Principles {.smaller}\n\n***Sustainability:** to be as efficient and impactful as possible, open science should build on long-term practices, services, infrastructures and funding models that ensure the equal participation of scientific producers from less privileged institutions and countries. Open science infrastructures should be organized and financed upon an essentially not-for-profit and long-term vision, which enhance open science practices and guarantee permanent and unrestricted access to all, to the largest extent possible.* -- UNESCO, 2021\n\n<br>\n\n**TL;DR:** Open Science requires sustainable, inclusive, and not-for-profit infrastructures ensuring equal global participation and access.\n\n# Why does Open Science matter?\n\n## Why does Open Science matter? {.smaller}\n\n- Increases accessibility to scientific knowledge for all\n- Enhances transparency and trust in research processes and results\n- Accelerates discovery and innovation through wider data and knowledge sharing\n- Improves research quality by enabling verification and reproducibility\n- Fosters global collaboration across disciplines, regions, and cultures\n- Promotes equity and inclusion by involving underrepresented communities and researchers\n- Maximises societal impact by making research outcomes available for public benefit\n- Encourages responsible and ethical science through openness and accountability\n- **Funders may require it** (e.g. NERC requires environmental data collected from the activities it funds to be made openly available within two years of their collection)\n\n# How can we promote Open Science as a department?\n\n## How can we promote Open Science as a department? {.smaller}\n\nPoints to consider:\n\n- What are we already doing well?
