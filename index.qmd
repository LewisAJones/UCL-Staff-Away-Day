# Open Science

## What is Open Science?

***Open Science** is a movement and set of practices aimed at making scientific research more accessible, transparent, and reusable for everyone â€” not just for other scientists, but also for the public, educators, policymakers, and industry.*

## Open Science Values and Principles

## Content

Benefits of Open Science:
Promotes collaboration and trust in science.
Makes research reproducible and verifiable.
Helps avoid duplication of effort.
Accelerates discovery and innovation.
Increases the impact and visibility of research.
Examples:
Publishing in Open Access journals (like PLOS ONE or eLife).
Depositing data in repositories like Zenodo or Dryad.
Sharing code on platforms like GitHub.
In short: Open Science = Science for Everyone â€” removing barriers to knowledge and enabling progress through transparency and sharing.

Open Access:
Research articles and data should be freely available to everyone, without paywalls or subscription barriers.
Open Data:
Raw data underlying scientific studies should be shared so others can verify results or reuse the data for new research.
Open Source:
Scientific software, code, and tools should be openly shared for inspection, improvement, and reuse.
Open Methodology:
Researchers should transparently document and share their methods, protocols, and workflows to ensure reproducibility.
Open Peer Review:
The peer-review process should be transparent, and sometimes even open to public participation or comment.
Open Educational Resources:
Teaching materials and learning resources should be freely accessible to educators and learners worldwide.

## What programming language(s) should we teach our students? {.smaller}

Points to consider:

- Should we even teach programming?
- What do we already teach? And why?
- What is the gateway programming language?
- What resources are available to support teaching and learning?
- What will make our students competitive now, and in the future?
- Is there benefit in teaching multiple languages or developing strong skills in one?
- What can we teach with our current skill set?

# Why should we teach R?

## Why should we teach R?

#### R is Open-Source and Free

- Unlike costly proprietary software (e.g., SPSS, SAS, MATLAB), R is free and open-source
- This makes it accessible to all students, even after graduationâ€”an important equity consideration

#### Encourages Reproducible Science

- R (especially with R Markdown and Quarto) fosters reproducible data analysis, a growing priority in scientific and social research

## Why should we teach R?

#### Gentler learning curve

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
# Example dataset: 'students.csv'
# (Assume it has columns: Name, Age, Gender, Score, Passed)
students <- read_csv("students.csv")

clean_students <- students %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  filter(Age >= 18) %>%
  select(Name, Age, Gender, Score) %>%
  mutate(Grade = case_when(
    Score >= 90 ~ "A",
    Score >= 80 ~ "B",
    Score >= 70 ~ "C",
    TRUE        ~ "D"
  )) %>%
  arrange(desc(Score))
```

## Why should we teach R?

#### Gentler learning curve

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# Load necessary packages
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
# 1. Load dataset
# Example dataset: 'students.csv'
# (Assume it has columns: Name, Age, Gender, Score, Passed)
students <- read_csv("students.csv")
# 2. Clean the data using dplyr
clean_students <- students %>%
  # Remove rows with any missing values
  drop_na() %>%
  # Filter students aged 18 or older
  filter(Age >= 18) %>%
  # Select only relevant columns
  select(Name, Age, Gender, Score) %>%
  # Create a new column 'Grade' based on Score
  mutate(Grade = case_when(
    Score >= 90 ~ "A",
    Score >= 80 ~ "B",
    Score >= 70 ~ "C",
    TRUE        ~ "D"
  )) %>%
  # Arrange the data by Score in descending order
  arrange(desc(Score))
```

## Why should we teach R?

#### Teaches Logical and Computational Thinking

- Builds skills in problem-solving, logic, algorithmic thinking

#### Bridges Theory and Practice

- Apply statistical and methodological concepts learnt in class to real data

#### Transferable Skills

- Skills learnt transferable to other languages like Python or Julia, as well as to general digital literacy

## Why should we teach R?

#### Widely Used in Research and Industry

- R is widely used in academia and increasingly in industry (data science, analytics)
- Learning R prepares students for both graduate research and job markets

#### Massive Community and Learning Resources

- R has an active community offering packages, tutorials, and forumsâ€”ideal for students to continue learning independently.
