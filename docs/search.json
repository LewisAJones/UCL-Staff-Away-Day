It comprises all scientific disciplines and aspects of scholarly practices, including basic and applied sciences, natural and social sciences and the humanities, and it builds on the following key pillars: open scientific knowledge, open science infrastructures, science communication, open engagement of societal actors and open dialogue with other knowledge systems. â€“ UNESCO, 2021\n\n\n\n\nUNESCO Recommendation on Open Science, 2021"
